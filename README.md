## Requirements:

A traditional tic-tac-toe game with a backend and front-end both whiten with Typescript. On the FE side there won't be support of any framework like ReactJs or Angular and it should contain a main screen with some logo, background and a start button. After the user press start button, a unique URL should be generated and he/she can select which color/symbol to play and send the URL for another player join the game. After the other play access and URL and select the other play option the game starts. Each player move should be shown in real time. If the user close the URL it should be able to access the game again using the same URL before it expires or the game is concluded.

The BE should provide the websocket solution for the real time event and generate the URLs.

Both projects should be test converged.
